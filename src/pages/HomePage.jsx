            As a chef, my work-life balance was completely out of sync. It
            wasn't until I started using this app that I noticed work was taking
            up more than 60% of my time and as a result, my emotional state
            wasn't great. Using balance has given me the tools and understanding
            of how to improve the quality of my life.

            Everybody knows self-care is a big deal, however, I didn't give it
            much thought until I started using balance. Since then, I've noticed
            I do not spend enough time taking care of my physical and emotional
            needs and I have been able to take steps towards correcting this. As
            a result, I've noticed my daily mood input has become more positive,
            and I feel better as a whole.

            I don't use this app. I don't believe in work-life balance. This is
            stupid. Why can't I work 24h a day? Ah, I remember, it's because my
            wife won't let me. Okay, I'll give it a try. Can I get a thumbs up?

            Let me see... Okay... Okay... Alright, so: this app is quite okay.
            Well... I guess... the more you know! Maybe this will work.

            I only signed up to this app because I thought this is where they
            organize Magic the Gathering. Maybe it could help me start the
            revolution against totalitarian teachers. Either way, I might use
            it, but not to track my sleep. Sleeping is for the weak.
