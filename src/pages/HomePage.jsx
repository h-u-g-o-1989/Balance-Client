            As a 21st century human, you have probably noticed how hectic the
            world around you is. With so many responsibilities, it's very easy
            to get stuck into a rhythm that does not benefit you or your
            long-term health.
          </p>

          <p className="two">
            Here at balance our goal is to provide you with a visual tool for
            gaining better knowledge of your daily routine and how it influences

                As a chef, my work-life balance was completely out of sync. It
                wasn't until I started using this app that I noticed work was
                taking up more than 60% of my time and as a result, my emotional
                state wasn't great. Using balance has given me the tools and
                understanding of how to improve the quality of my life.

                Everybody knows self-care is a big deal, however, I didn't give
                it much thought until I started using balance. Since then, I've
                noticed I do not spend enough time taking care of my physical
                and emotional needs and I have been able to take steps towards
                correcting this. As a result, I've noticed my daily mood input
                has become more positive, and I feel better as a whole.

                I don't use this app. I don't believe in work-life balance. This
                is stupid. Why can't I work 24h a day? Ah, I remember, it's
                because my wife won't let me. Okay, I'll give it a try. Can I
                get a thumbs up? üëç

                Let me see... Okay... Okay... Alright, so: this app is quite
                okay. Well... I guess... the more you know! Maybe this will
                work.

                I only signed up to this app because I thought this is where
                they organize Magic the Gathering. Maybe it could help me start
                the revolution against totalitarian teachers. Either way, I
                might use it, but not to track my sleep. Sleeping is for the
                weak.
