        <h3>How I Stopped Working So Much And What I Learned From Doing So</h3>
        <p>
          We know when we work too much—we just don’t know what to do about it.
          Whether we love or hate our job, it’s easy to become consumed by it
          and destroy our work-life balance in the process. But it doesn’t have
          to be that way....

        <p>

          Hans Selye first identified and documented stress. Symptoms of stress
          existed long before Selye, but his discoveries led to new research
          that has helped millions cope with stress. We’ve compiled a list of

        <h3>How to Improve Your Work-Life Balance Today</h3>
        <p>
          Often, work takes precedence over everything else in our lives. Our
          desire to succeed professionally can push us to set aside our own
          well-being. Creating a harmonious work-life balance or work-life
          integration is critical, though, to improve not only our physical,
          emotional and mental well-being, but it's also important for our
          career...
